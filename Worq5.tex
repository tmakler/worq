\section{Problem B}

Cassandra got a 5 percent raise and Vicky got a 6 percent raise. Cassandra claimed that she got more money than Vicky. It it possible that Cassandra is correct? Why or why not?

To solve this problem, I started out by thinking about the 5 percent and 6 percent increase. If Cassandra had started out with more money than Vicky, was it possible that Cassandra could receive more money? To see if it was possible, I wrote this formula:
$$1.05x > 1.06y$$
To simplify this inequality, divide each side by 1.05.
$$x > \frac{1.06}{1.05}y$$
To see if this works with values of $x$ and $y$, lets plug in 2,000 for $y$.
\begin{align}
x >& \frac{1.06}{1.05}\times2000\\
x >& 2020
\end{align}
