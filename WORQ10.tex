\section{Problem B}

Create a unit of length so that the pencil above would be more than 2 units long but less than three units long. Explain how you decided on the length of you unit.
(The pencil is 3$\frac{1}{2}$ '' long)

First, I decided that I want to make the pencil 2$\frac{1}{2}$ of my unit because that is between 2 and 3. I know that the pencil is 3$\frac{1}{2}$ '' long, so I can write an equation to show how long one of my units is in inches.
$$3\frac{1}{2}=2\frac{1}{2}x$$
If I solve for $x$, then I will find the length of my unit in inches.
$$\frac{7}{2}=\frac{5}{2}x$$
$$\frac{7}{2}\times\frac{2}{5}=x$$
$$\frac{7}{5}=x$$
$$1.4=x$$
From these equations, I have found that each of my units is 1.4 inches long. 2$\frac{1}{2}$ of these units is the length of the pencil.

\section{Problem C}

Give the coordinates of the vertices of and isosceles triangle whose axis of symmetry is not parallel to either axis. Show that your triangle is isosceles.

I know that if I make an isosceles triangle whose base has a slope of 1, the axis of symmetry will not be parallel to either axis.
